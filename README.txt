This is a program written in C# that is designed to run in a Visual Studio environment.
This project is a video game composed of a single level that allows the user to play as
the Pokemon 'Pikachu' and battle an opponent in a 2D battlefield. This program incorporates
graphics and hitboxes as well as the math required to design these aspects.

Unfortunately, although this is my favorite project, I lost the source code to this project.
However, I wanted to place this project in my GitHub anyways purely because it is my favorite.
